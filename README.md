# Assay Development!

To document assay development for the [Zivkovic's lab](https://zivkoviclab.ucdavis.edu/). We are interested in investigating functional markers of high-density lipoproteins ("good cholesterol") as measure of health and disease status.

# Antioxidant Capacity Assay

- This cell-free assay can be performed on a 96-well plate. 
- CVs were decent ~1-12%.
- Works well with ApoB-depleted plasma and most likely plasma.
- Not compatible with HDL isolated by UC+FPLC.

# Lecithinâ€“Cholesterol Acyltransferase (LCAT) Activity Assay

- This cell-free assay can be performed on a 96-well plate. 
- CVs were fantastic <3%.
- Works well with HDL isolated by UC+FPLC, plasma and ApoB-depleted plasma.
- Clear dose reponse with increasing sample concentration.

# Cholesterol Efflux Capacity (CEC) Assay

- This cell-based assay is be performed on a 96-well plate. 
- New method is robust, most CVs <3%. 
- Works with ApoB-depleted plasma and isolated HDL (UC+FPLC). Does not work with untreated plasma (media clumps with plasma).
- Works on multiple cell lines. Cells tested on J774A.1 and HMC3 microglia.
