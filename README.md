# Assay Development!

To document assay development for the Zivkovic's lab. We are interested in investigating functional markers of high-density lipoproteins ("good cholesterol") as measure of health and disease status.

# Antioxidant Capacity Assay

- This cell-free assay can be performed on a 96-well plate. 
- CVs were decent ~5-10%.
- Works well with ApoB-depleted plasma and most likely plasma.
- Not compatible with HDL isolated by UC+FPLC.

# Lecithinâ€“cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity assay

- This cell-free assay can be performed on a 96-well plate. 
- CVs were fantastic <3%.
- Works well with HDL isolated by UC+FPLC and plasma. Most likely work with ApoB-depleted plasma.
- Clear dose reponse with increasing sample concentration.
